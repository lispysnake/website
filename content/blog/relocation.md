Well, despite the madness of the world right now, we have been working. Much of what
is happening is being discussed on our IRC channel, with a core group beginning to
emerge. However, development work has been reduced of late as we're in the midst of
relocation.

### Homeward Bound

Next month I (Ikey) will be moving back to the Republic of Ireland. Currently this is
planned on or around the 17th of July. A few things have to happen before that, including:

 - Car repairs to be completed around 16th July (Remember the crash?)
 - Oldest son's cast to be removed on 10th July (Broke his elbow, fell off bike)
 - Youngest son's christening on 11th July

I think we all know why I might be inclined to leave the UK (again) but I'll not be listing
those reasons here, as this is the blog of an amazing open source project, and nobody cares
that much :D

It should be noted I've been back and forth for a while, but settling here is just proving
too problematic.

### Next Steps

When the dust settles (It really won't take too long) there will be a significant reinvestment
of work-hours into Serpent, and our related, evolving, toolchain work. These are incredibly
interesting times for Lispy Snake, and there has never been a better time to get involved.

Please join our IRC channel (`#serpent-framework`) on freenode to join the discussion!

Once the move is complete, we will be disbanding the UK Entity `Lispy Snake, Ltd.`.
Initially we will continue as an open source project in Ireland, until all the relevant paperwork
and such has been completed to incorporate as an Irish company.

Note that all license purchases will be valid wherever our company is. We're currently having
some minor issues with our email, however, as we're in the process of moving. This will all be
resolved in the coming weeks, so stay tuned!

### Tip for the ferry

We (family and myself) have a very long trip! Over 300 miles to Fishguard, then over the ferry
to Rosslare. Even then, we have more driving before we reach our final destination: ~~Supermacs\*~~ Home.

If you want to support us with the journey, for a few bags of Taytos\* or even a lick of diesel, it'll
get us settled on the farside much quicker. If Lispy Snake has proven anything so far, it takes a whole
lot more than the apocolypse to finish us off.

Alternatively, as usual, you can purchase a lifetime license :)
