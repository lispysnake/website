**Lispy Snake, Ltd** was founded by veteran open source engineer, Ikey Doherty, in 2019.
Primarily we are a game studio, and we will begin to work on our game titles as and when
[Serpent](/serpent) reaches sufficient levels of maturity.

Our roots run deep in software engineering, open source software architecture and Linux distribution
development. Our development ethos manifest itself in our software, leading to high quality tooling
and libraries.

### {{<fontawesome fab fa-osi>}} Open Source

We don't believe in "free & source available" solutions. Serpent, and all of our projects, are completely
free and open source, for anyone to use, examine and contribute to.

Our software remains open source, under [OSI](https://opensource.org/) compliant licenses. Serpent and the related subprojects are
all available under the terms of the [ZLib](https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib) license.

### {{<fontawesome fa fa-linux>}} Linux First

We run Linux daily, here. We use it for everything, and it is core to our development processes.
As such our framework and titles put Linux first, instead of being a second-class citizen. The net
result is maximum portability, allowing us to bring Serpent to more platforms, without the headaches
and bugs.
