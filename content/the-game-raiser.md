For a limited time, we're running an investment crowdfunding opportunity in
Lispy Snake, Ltd. We're offering a lifetime license for all of our upcoming
2D game titles, for only $20!

There are only *500* licenses available during this run. This bootstrap
will help get our first title out even quicker, giving you lifetime access
to all of our upcoming 2D game titles. Oh, and Linux support is a given. {{<fontawesome fab fa-linux>}} {{<fontawesome fa fa-heart>}}

## Gaming Framework (Serpent)

**Enter the (miniature) dragon.**

We're starting development of a replacement Game Framework to our old
engine efforts, leveraging best-in-class open source libraries for
various core functions.

That project is called [{{<fontawesome fab fa-github>}} Serpent](https://github.com/lispysnake/serpent)
and you can watch our development unfold daily.

Our core goals remain to have a 2D gaming framework with a cross-platform
3D pipeline. We want Indie Developers, like us, to benefit the most from
a powerful gaming kit on all platforms, with minimal fuss.

## [The Last Peacekeeper](/the-last-peacekeeper)

Our first game is helping us to build the engine in parallel. The game is called
The Last Peacekeeper and it features amazing mechanics and story.
Think, 'Battlestar Galactica\*' meets 'Homeworld\*' in an awesome 2D strategy-esque
mashup. Dark storylines, heartbreaks and hope-crushers are the norm.
The storyline will take precedence over visuals, taking you on a journey
with our realistic, gritty characters as they face up to the human condition
in new levels of isolation.

## Support It Now

Our timescale is largely dependent right now on reinvestment from our
contracting work, meaning the game development is currently happening
'between gigs'. With The Game Raiser, you'll get lifetime access to
all of our future titles, and help to significantly reduce time to market
for our engine and first title.
