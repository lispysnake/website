Before you check this page out, you should first check out our [Serpent](/serpent) page to get an idea
of exactly what we're looking to achieve. It's ambitious, but we're fully confident we can pull
it off. We already have a [demo](/download) out to show off our progress!

### Community Fundraising

We're offering a limited number (500) of 'lifetime licenses' to community investors.
This will automatically entitle them to full, lifetime access to **all** of our upcoming
game titles.

We originally poised this as a 2D-only license, but we're feeling super appreciative of the community support!
This license will entitle lifetime access toall titles, regardless of being 2D, 3D, 2.5D or viewed-through-binoculars.

So, without further ado, go grab a license!

### Community Donations

If you want to leave a tip for our work, we won't object! All contributions help, no matter how small.
The goal is shared, bring Serpent (and subsequent game titles) to market more rapidly. A license isn't
always to everyones taste, we get that.

### Support Now!

Trust us - we know how hard things are right now. However we want to look
to the future, and we'd love if you were part of that adventure. We work
full time on Serpent, the associated libraries, cross-compilers, etc, to
help bring a new level of industry-standard awesome to the open source world.
