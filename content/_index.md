Welcome to the home of **Serpent**, the Game and Content Engine. A project that has been
under development for almost a year, completely free and open source, under the liberal
ZLib license.

Serpent is itself based on the latest cross-platform open source technologies such as
[bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) and [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/). Contrary to other 'mainstream' engines, we don't use C++, instead preferring the [D Language](https://dlang.org/).

Right now we're at full battle stations, working around the clock to bring Serpent closer
to the first public, stable release. Until then, know that much will change and improve!

You can learn more about Serpent [here](/serpent).
